INTRODUCTION TO BLACKJACK GAME :

Blackjack is a card game where the objective is to accumulate cards with a total value as close to 21 
as possible without exceeding it. 
If your hand's total exceeds 21, it is called a bust, and you lose immediately regardless of how much you have gone over.

CARD VALUES :

Cards 2 through 10 count as their face value.
Jack, Queen, and King each count as 10.
The Ace can count as either 1 or 11, depending on whether counting it as 11 would cause the hand to bust.

''' AT THE BEGINNING I WAS SO UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS GAME'S LOGIC.....BUT I SOMEHOW CRACKED IT AND WROTE THIS.
 (Scrolling btw this 'if','elif','else' made me go crazy üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠, but yeah it was worth the efforts)
 You can find this code's easier version online, but I recommend doing it by yourself.
 Obviously there are many changes you can commit for vulnerabilities as well as for smooth user-experience.
 And to make this 'artsy' logo just ask chatgpt to make it for you in ASCII CODE
 SUIT YOURSELF ‚ù§Ô∏è
